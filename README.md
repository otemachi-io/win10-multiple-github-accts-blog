# SSH Keys, multiple GitHub accounts, and VSCode on Windows 10. #

This git repository is for the resources used on a blog.  

*There is no security issue here:*

The private and public keys are used purely for demostration purpose and are no longer assoicated with a github account, nor are they useful for anything, unless you decide to make them so, but I would not advise it, they are for playing, labbing, and so on. They have no passwords, so another reason not to use them.

The files exists, because I think it is always nice to be able to see the files as they were on a system, even if the text of the blog is accurate enough.

Thank you for reading.
